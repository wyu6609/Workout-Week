Build a full-stack web app in Replit called “Workout Week Generator”.

Tech:
- Frontend: React + Vite + TypeScript
- Backend: Node.js + Express (TypeScript)
- Styling: simple CSS (no tailwind required)
- One repo with /client and /server folders
- Use a single “dev” command that runs both client + server concurrently.

Core features:
1) A form where user selects:
   - goal: fat_loss | muscle_gain | strength | endurance | mobility
   - experience: beginner | intermediate | advanced
   - days_per_week: 3–7
   - minutes_per_session: 15–60
   - cardio_preference: none | low_impact | hiit_ok | running_ok
   - constraints: free-text (e.g. knee pain, wrist pain)
   - focus: full_body | upper | lower | core | glutes | posture
   - household_items_allowed: boolean
   - baseline test inputs:
       pushups_max (optional number)
       squats_max (optional number)
       plank_seconds (optional number)

2) On submit, call backend POST /api/generate-plan with the form data.

3) Backend generates a workout plan WITHOUT calling external APIs:
   - Use deterministic logic + templates (hardcode exercise library).
   - Output JSON following this schema:
     {
       plan_name: string,
       overview: { goal: string, weekly_structure: string, intensity_guidance: string },
       days: [
         {
           day: string,
           focus: string,
           duration_minutes: number,
           warmup: [{ name: string, time_seconds: number, cues: string[] }],
           workout: [
             {
               block_name: string,
               format: "sets_reps" | "emom" | "amrap" | "circuit" | "intervals",
               exercises: [
                 {
                   name: string,
                   sets: number,
                   reps: string,
                   rest_seconds: number,
                   tempo: string,
                   rpe: number,
                   form_cues: string[],
                   substitutions: {
                     easier: string,
                     harder: string,
                     knee_friendly: string,
                     wrist_friendly: string
                   }
                 }
               ]
             }
           ],
           cooldown: [{ name: string, time_seconds: number, cues: string[] }]
         }
       ],
       next_week_progression: string[]
     }

Generation rules:
- No equipment required by default. If household_items_allowed=true, you may use chair/sofa/wall/towel/backpack.
- Include warm-up (3–6 min), main work, cooldown (2–4 min).
- Use progressive overload across the week (add reps/sets, reduce rest, harder variation, or tempo).
- Default main work at RPE 7–8, scale down if beginner or constraints mention pain.
- Include substitutions for each exercise (easier/harder/knee/wrist).
- If days_per_week >= 5, include 1 recovery/rest day.

4) Frontend renders the returned plan as:
   - A weekly list view (Day cards)
   - Each card shows warmup, blocks, exercises, cooldown
   - Button: “Copy plan as JSON”
   - Button: “Download plan as .json” (client-side)

Engineering requirements:
- Provide a clean exercise library file on the backend (arrays/objects) grouped by movement patterns:
  push, pull (if household allowed), squat, hinge, core, cardio
- Input validation with zod on backend.
- Good error messages to UI.
- Add README with how to run.

Deliverables:
- Working app in Replit with run button
- File structure:
  /client (Vite React TS)
  /server (Express TS)
  root package.json using concurrently to run both
- Include sample plan generation for each goal to confirm it works.
